# EuroMillions
Written in C# Windows Form App that allows User to enter EuroMillions numbers

These numbers will be checked against all winning draws. 
The result will inform if the numbers entered have ever won the EuroMillions or the closest they have come. 
It will return the date of the win or partial win and how close it came e.g. 3 numbers and 2 hotpicks on the 21/05/2015.

This will return the number of times each Euromillion number has been drawn over this timeframe (in the format of EuroMillions = 5 numbers + 2 hotpicks)
